# SHA-256_password_creator
This is a quick command-line Python3 tool that utilises SHA-256 hashing to more securely store passwords in Python3 projects.  I designed it to be used for testing purposes, and if you like the test, feel free to implement these functions into your project(s).  It seems a lot more secure to me to store hashes for passwords rather than the very passwords themselves.  Thank you, have a great day, all!

If, for any reason, you would like to donate- though unneccesary, is always apreciated!
